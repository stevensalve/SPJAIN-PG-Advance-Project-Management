<b>About The Course</b>

<p>
Though the responses of India's corporate sector and management education Institutions are not as quick and comprehensive as expected, the current decade is likely a decade of "management by projects" in India.<br>

In response to these challenges, SPJIMR offers a restructured, more relevant and value-added "Post Graduate in Advanced Project Management" (PG-APM) to managers extensively experienced in some specific project management activities and wanting to acquire a well-rounded holistic perspective on project management.<br>

The programme primarily aims to help participants in understanding the globally recognized Framework for Project Management. Take up Accountability, Strategizing, Visualization, Planning, Scheduling, Monitoring and grow to higher level of decision making.<br>
